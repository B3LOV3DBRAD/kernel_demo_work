# kernel_demo_work

This project is a small experiment using the Kernel SDK and Stagehand to build an AI-powered API endpoint. The goal was to spin up a local browser, navigate Hacker News, and extract article links related to any given topic using GPT-4o.

---

## What I Did
- Built a Next.js API route that connects to Kernel and Stagehand  
- Used GPT-4o to interpret and extract relevant article links  
- Tested requests locally with Postman and verified structured JSON responses

## Tech Involved
- **Next.js 15** (API routes)  
- **TypeScript**  
- **Kernel SDK** (`@onkernel/sdk`)  
- **Stagehand** (`@browserbasehq/stagehand`)  
- **OpenAI GPT-4o**  
- **Zod** for schema validation
